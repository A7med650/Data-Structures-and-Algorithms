# Data Structures

****Data structures**** are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. They define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program.

## ****Classification of Data Structure:****

1.****Linear Data Structure****: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.  
****Example:**** Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

2.****Non-Linear Data Structure:**** Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can't traverse all the elements in a single run only.  
****Examples:**** Trees and Graphs.

## ****Most Popular Data Structures:****

[1. Array](#array)

## Array

1.**Array**:An array is a collection of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

## Complexity Analysis of Operations on Array

### Time Complexity

| Operation             | Worst Case |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| ****Traversal****     | O(N)       |
| ****Append****        | O(1)       |
| ****Insert****        | O(N)       |
| ****Max****           | O(N)       |
| ****Min****           | O(N)       |
| ****Sum****           | O(N)       |
| ****Avg****           | O(N)       |
| ****Reverse****       | O(N)       |
| ****Expand****        | O(N)       |
| ****Deletion****      | O(N)       |
| ****Linear Search**** | O(N)       |
| ****Binary Search**** | O(log n)   |
| ****Sort****          | O($n^2$)   |
